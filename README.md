# 15 MIRROR PUZZLE

Well, I finally packaged my app into android apk file. Add the 'normal','nightmare','hell' modes, which may bring several fun. For me, the nightmare mode is really a nightmare :) Hope you can enjoy it!

## How to play
download the .apk file from bin folder,then install it on android device
tap the block to move, notice only the available block can move :)
to run it from source, need python3 and kivy, just run the main.py
