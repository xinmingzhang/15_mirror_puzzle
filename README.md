# Duckshooting 

My second kivy project, just for [Reddit-pygame challange](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/6mpdbh/challenge_shooting_gallery/) & [OGA game jam](https://itch.io/jam/opengame-art-game-jam) :)
* SPECIAL THANKS to /u/iminurnamez  :)
## How to play
On Windows, unzip the duck.zip, then run duck.exe (no sound)
On Android, install the apk file.
