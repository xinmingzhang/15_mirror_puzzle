# 15 MIRROR SLIDE PUZZLE

Well, I finished this game during a weekend. When I finish it, I find it is SUPER HARD! I would spend nearly an hour to get the solution. I want to make it easier, but I have no ideas and no time. And I do not package it for android, I found it crashed in kivy laucher :)

Anyhow, I think this game idea is special, so just show it, maybe when I have time, I would do it better! And if you want to test your IQ, just try it :)


## How to play
